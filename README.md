# advent-of-code-2018
https://adventofcode.com

This is my attempt at some of the code advent problems. I will try and do them all, but inevitably, I will get bored/stuck at some point and give up.

I'm also going to try and do this in Python to learn something, as I think with R it will either be too easy or too frustrating.

I also want to try and write unit tests for everything, just to try and encourage myself to follow best practices.

## What did I learn?

### Day 1
- Using `itertools` to cycle through the lists is far quicker than any loop
- Using a dictionary (i.e. curly brackets `{}`)

###Â Day 2
- Using `enumerate` to get an itemised list.
- Loading in a text file into a list
- Using `Counter` from `collections` to count the number of letters in a string.

### Day 3
- Regular Expressions (though I didn't really learn this - rather just copied from Reddit)
-
