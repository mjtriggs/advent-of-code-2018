# advent-of-code-2018
https://adventofcode.com

This is my attempt at some of the code advent problems. I will try and do them all, but inevitably, I will get bored/stuck at some point and give up.

I'm also going to try and do this in Python to learn something, as I think with R it will either be too easy or too frustrating.

I also want to try and write unit tests for everything, just to try and encourage myself to follow best practices.
